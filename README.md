# Movie-Recommendation-System


Utilized Python within a Data Science and Machine Learning context to design and implement a robust movie recommendation system. Employed various techniques such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches to suggest movies based on user preferences and item similarities. Leveraged libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn to preprocess, analyze, and model large-scale movie datasets, extracting meaningful insights to enhance recommendation accuracy.

Implemented collaborative filtering algorithms like user-item collaborative filtering or matrix factorization, considering user behavior and preferences to generate personalized recommendations. Additionally, incorporated content-based methods that analyze movie metadata (e.g., genre, actors, directors) to suggest similar items based on a user's history.

Evaluated model performance using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) or precision-recall to fine-tune algorithms and enhance recommendation quality. Collaborated with cross-functional teams to deploy the system in production, ensuring scalability, efficiency, and seamless integration with existing platforms.

This experience in building a movie recommendation system strengthened skills in Python programming, data preprocessing, machine learning algorithms, and model evaluation within the realm of Data Science and ML applications.
